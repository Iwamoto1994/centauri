# Deep Learning Framework

## Introduction

This repository is for studying to create and experiment with deep learning libraries based on O'Reilly Japan's "Deep Learning 3 from scratch".

The original repository URL is shown below.

## Centauri

I named the framework "Centauri" so that it can be developed with love. It is derived from a small low-mass star, Proxima Centauri.
